Plutus Core Semantics
=====================

This repository will contains the K Framework implementation of the core
language of the Plutus language ([a prototype of Plutus can be viewed
here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-prototype)).

Usage
-----

The `build` script is responsible for building and running tests.
For the first build, run `./build deps [options for pytest]`.
This will build all dependencies, including K, IELE and its dependencies,
and a `virtualenv` with `pytest` installed.

For subsequent builds run `./build [options for pytest]`.

To execute a Plutus program, run: `./build kplc run execution <pgm.plc> [arguments to bin/kplc]`.

To translate to IELE, run: `./build kplc run translate <pgm.plc> [arguments to bin/kplc]`.

To Do
-----

### Execution

- Remove let, tests that involve let
- `define` can only take in a `Val` not a `Tm`. Some tests probably will fail
  but first we need to rewrite all tests to be syntactically valid now.
- Check if [test/execution/import-nonexistent.expected] should get stuck?

See tests marked `xfail` for more To-dos.

Issues
------


### New issues

1. The behaviour of `takeByteString` of a non-zero value from the empty
   bytestring is not defined in the spec. We assume we should get stuck and
   fail?

2. Is Prelude assumed to be imported always? If not, how do comparison operators work with returning something of type `(con Prelude.Bool)`
  - On the same note, should we be able to write `(define myTrue (Prelude.True))` without importing Prelude?

### Old Issues

1. Typo in the `abs` rule for `checks`, lower case `k` should be capital `K`.
2. In `con` rule for `checks`, the condition with `forall` is not syntactically valid (does not parse as a `Type`). The application should be wrapped in `con`?
   > Answer: no, this judgment is not supposed to parse as a `Type`, it is just supposed to look like a `Type`
3. What do the Oxford (semantic) brackets mean?
   > Answer: `[[_]]` is shorthand for that unique `U` such that `T => U` (ie `T` evaluates to `U`)
4. In the CK machine, the ~5th to last rule has syntax of the form `case on ... of ...` which doesn't seem to be defined anywhere
5. 2nd sentence of Section IV: "... executes and leads true ..." should either be "leaves" or "leads to"

6. Just to confirm, a program like `(define r [f 3])` is not valid?
   > Answer: No this is not valid. Execution is done with validator/redeemer and bind. Is there an example of this?

7. The `S'` is confusing in `case` rule for checks. Can you elaborate what this refers to?
8. \bar{alt} checks c \bar{T} used in a few place (`con-valid-local` for example) but not defined anywhere as far as I can tell
9. The spec has `(isa Ty Tm)` but the prelude has `(isa Tm Ty)`
10. The spec has `builtin addInt`, `builtin multiplyInt`, etc. but the prelude has `builtin addInteger`, etc.
11. The spec has `Prelude.Boolean` but the prelude has `Prelude.Bool`
12. Can you elaborate on what the \bar{S} and \bar{alpha} refers to in the `con` rule for checks and `case` rule? It seems it is related to the specific `Alt` that matches the constructor but this is not very clear and a bit confusing to me.
13. There doesn't seem to be any rule for `declare`. Related, I thought `define` should do a checking judgment against the declared type (if such a type exists), there doesn't seem to be a rule for this either.
14. Can you please point us to where in the spec judgments check for well-kindedness? For example should it be in the `isa` judgment?

In general, when new variables appear in the conditions of a rule that are not in the conclusion of a rule, it is often confusing as to where they came from, at least for me.
