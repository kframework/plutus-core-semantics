  // Testing transfer(To,Value) when To = caller and possibly overflow.
  // There is no overflow with our ERC20 spec, however, because we assumed that
  // implementations are more likely to first deduct the Value from the caller
  // and then add it to the receiver.  Implementations that first add and then
  // deduct will therefore be incorrect with this version of the ERC20 spec.
  // This test also shows that we cannot let transfer to self naively follow from
  // the general/default definition of transfer, because the latter checks
  // `BalanceTo +Int Value <=Int MAXVALUE` and throws if false.
  // Recall that 2^256 (a 78 digit numer) is:
